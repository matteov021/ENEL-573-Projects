ARRIVAL: A new packet arrives
DEPARTURE: A packet finishes service
OBSERVER: Look at the system to measure performance

METRICS
-> How many packets are in the system (E[N])
-> How often the system is idle (PIDLE)
-> How often packets are dropped (PLOSS)

Store all events in a list, sorted by event time
Generate arrival and observer events before the simulation starts (lamda and mu) (exponential distribution from part 1)
Observer is 3x Arrival

Add events to list in sorted order

Loop
-> Remove first event
-> Calculate how long event took
-> Run time if queue has nothing in it
-> If Arrival -> Increase Na and Queue Length, Schedule Departure If Queue Empty
-> Else If Departure -> Increase Na and Decrease Queue Length, Schedule Departure If Queue > 0
-> Else if -> Increase No and Add Queue Length to Sum
-> Free the queue

Results
-> Calculate En
-> Calculate PIDLE
